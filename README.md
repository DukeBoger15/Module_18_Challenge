# Module_18_Challenge
This repository contains the code for my FinTech Bootcamp Module 18 Challenge
<h1>Background</h1>
In this challenge I am assuming the role of a fintech engineer who is working for one of the five largest banks in the world. I was recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. My task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
<h2>What I Am Creating</h2>
I will make updates to the provided Python file for this Challenge, which already contains the basic PyChain ledger structure that we created throughout the module:
<li>Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.</li>
<li>Change the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute that's of type.</li>
<li>Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that we will store in the PyChain ledger.</li>
<h2>Libraries & Programs Used</h2>
<li>Streamlit</li>
<li>Data Classes</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>datetime</li>
<li>hashlib</li>
<li>typing<li>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<li>To use this application, please clone the repository and open VS Code. In VS Code, select the play (small triangle) in the upper right of the screen.</li>

<li>After you run the code, copy the streamlit run code and paste the streamlit line below and select enter to run the code. This should bring you to the PyChain ledger web interface.</li>
